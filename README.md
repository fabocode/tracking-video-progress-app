- Watch tracking: Checkboxes to mark each video watched; persisted across sessions.
- Playback controls: Play, pause, stop, skip Â±10 s, click-to-seek, and adjustable volume.
- Full-screen mode: Toggle full-screen and exit with Esc.
- Autoplay next: Automatically plays the next video when one finishes.
- Progress summary: Overall percentage complete and remaining videos count.
